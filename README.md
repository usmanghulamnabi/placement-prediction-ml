# Student Placement Prediction System (Python + ML + PyQt)

A desktop-based **Student Placement Prediction System** built using **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and a **modern PyQt GUI**.  
The application predicts whether a student is likely to get placed based on academic, skill-based, and experience-related features.

It also provides **model explainability** using **SHAP** and interactive **Plotly visualizations**.
